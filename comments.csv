If you cannot keep a child safe and provide them a good safe life, stop having sex!! I'd stop having sex so I wouldn't have to have another baby  stolen!!  Sex  isn't worth the life of a child and the sorrow of not knowing where your child is and what happened to them. Do these people know about how not to have babies?? Living on the streets and pushng out baby after baby after baby is child abuse and to keep having babies you cannot take care of and provide them safety and a home, then stop having sex until you are married to a good man who has a job and can provide for a family....  There are ways to get sexual pleasure to a man and woman that do not cause pregnancy.  These people should think of their future children's well being and to stop having babies."

Secondly , there's no honor among criminals , the honor of keeping a promise or rendez-vous is inexistent . Money is paramount ! You bait her with an upfront fee and an offer slightly above the maximum market price .
 Lastly , I doubt there's any proper  police involvement in this . In such cases , you assign a spy to execute constant monitoring . If this is how Kenyan police operates , then it's always a field day for the average smart criminal .

If they had better resources maybe some of them would not use that as an option. Vetting the families these babies are going to is the key. #2 Its wrong to steal someones baby. #3 Do you do abandoned babies at the hospital a service by taking them to shelter compared to a caring family? Let's say if there was an adoption option at the hospital and people could be easily vetted? I'm asking because the baby was abandoned and if its been days and 'people don't come back for their children (because they can't afford them), is it really better to send the baby to a shelter? I've heard some horrific shelter stories (in general). #4 Where exactly are the babies going that are being sacrificed and where is the discussion on that?

Most of Europe was poorer than Africa is now and for a much longer time and we never threw our kids into the street en masse and sold them into sex slavery. The problem if anything is 'aid' we give them money and they have too much irresponsible sex and therefore too many children and they don't respect human life enough to look after them.

@quickenyourlife9426,06/07/2022 19:10,0,0,"*UK-RWANDA MIGRANTS DEAL*

The deal is to send asylum seekers in the UK to Rwanda, near the EAST OF THE DR CONGO. WHY?

REPETITION OF HISTORY : 

- Boris Johnson has held talks with Rwanda's Paul Kagame on the controversial migrant deal. This, as Commonwealth nations hold talks with Kagame and Prince Charles over the deal. Boris Johnson is manipulating people to 'keep an open mind' amid meeting with Paul Kagame, for repetition of the fate of Australia. 
 
The DRC, a very rich country in everything, is envied by all. Having almost the size of a continent; it is coveted by UK who wants to play smart and dribble the other great eastern G7 (Belgium, France and and others...) and USA who are distracted and do not yet understand the game of the head of the Commonwealth to expand its empire and its dominance.
UK had played the same game for the *eradication of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (the Indigenous peoples of Australia).* 

Under the silence of all and in plain sight of the international community, the indigenous people of Australia have been destroyed and massacred. And then UK imported all kinds of citizens to build the new Commonwealth Australia.
THIS IS THE SAME PLAN that Boris is crafting through manipulation and misinformation in order by bringing  various people ""asylums seekers"" to Rwanda and depopulate the DRC.

This project of cunning men is already destroyed in the Name of Jesus Christ. It WON'T HAPPEN and it WILL NOT COME TO SUCCEED. ISAIAH 7.7
 *Rwanda is very small country!!!* Why didn't Boris choose a large country like South Africa, Namibia or Zambia? 
THE DEAL IS THE EASTERN PART OF THE DR CONGO. Boris is among those pulling the strings of the eastern DRC war for Machiavellian interests. 
Why not help the DRC to develop and its nationals to also enjoy its wealth. Why do they refuse to enter through the front door and deal directly and honestly with the current president of the DRC who is well disposed for the development of the country?
Kagame, the current Tipotipo, must know that his current action in the service of UK will have regrettable consequences against the Rwandan people. The wickedness of his current irresolute acts will one day turn against Rwandans. When the Commonwealth will  establish its populations in Rwanda, the first slaves and the last of all people will be the  blacks, Rwandan; unless the Rwandans change their skin color or race and become whites. They will later become SLAVES on their own land.
Kagame in ignorance, blind and wicked greed, works for the NEW WORLD ORDER which the ""Machiavelli"" have since ancient times resolved to establish, plan to eliminate and reduce the population of the world and to create their world according to their vision. This is why Kagame is actually called ""HITLER AND TIPOTIPO OF AFRICA"".

I fear that many of these babies are going to some seriously messed up situations, like sex trafficking. You have to be absolutely heartless to be able to do these things in the first place & just because someone has money doesn't mean they're going to make a better parent. The first time they saw Anita with the baby I thought they would follow them so that that wouldn't happen where the baby gets lost. People like Anita are not easily fooled and they know what to look for so I'm not surprised that happened, just sad for that baby & mom that they didn't follow them and do a better job of keeping track of where she was. As that may have been their only chance to ever see that child again. No doubt these babies are being used as slaves for sex trafficking or child labour. You have 3 hundred grand to buy a baby why not go through adoption, likely because they don't have good intentions of what they plan to do with this baby. A sick kind of business which harms society. Somehow we need to get the predators of human race out of business I just can't believe how many of them there are. Why with all this evidence were they not arrested?"

Is this a joke? 
Even though I appreciate your documentary and efforts and am sure you helped to raise the general awareness of this problem it simply can't be true that you did not use your opportunity to have these criminals arrested and brought to prison.

Human commodity for children, Organ Harvesting, Sex & the design to un-seat MANKIND'S MORALITY... to live free and safe, living in Harmony, building family... GLOBALLY. 

This situation is all over the world, it just look different and must stop. Advocating, All lives matter- young- old - the Earth and possibilities of living with good intentions. We should not be preyed upon.  To be poor is a crime... especially morally & emotionally.  Poverty and Matrix designs to stagnant mindset voided of integrity and sanctuary and by hopelessly choosing  instant gratitude, increases the acts of unwise choices, distances the heart. üåø What I  see, is in all circumstances, humanity is at is reckless power hungry- false living, high point again, bankrupted MORALITY is the demonstration, Revolution is LIVE as  in open war with its brethren. Where low levels conditioning wing of dis-Ease that whispers and withdraws,  impressing one to Sell a SOUL... Must be desperate to carry away  stolen seed or cut out the right kidney to induct same into an un-natural reality... Truly, we live in a space of uncertainty... Oh Lordy.

Sold to the highest bidder. Stealing the capability of living reproductively wholesomely without you eyeing me before the idea of what's in my belly and missing un-beknowst to me that was taken while sleeping and dreaming of baby- equal- 3.  üåø  We all must become aware of environments, trends and what governing leaders have to say and act upon... Stolen Lives. 

I am pleased that I LEARNED  more of what is happening in the world by viewing this relevant  investigative project. üèÖüéØAlso, I learned how there were appropriately, some arrest that resulted from this evidence-based reporting. More so, very educational for many. I will share with my family. üòè Hey, and also... Teaching how to survive and escape... Kidnapping, nor to NOT  drink the Kool-aid and how to bite thru tape. lol. 4real.

Many USA African children are taken everyday and depending your caste or color, makes a difference in how and if one's situation is given proper care to locate or solve missing person cases. All over the world it happens. May we protect ALL children & Humanity for MORALITY & GOODNESS sake. üèãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•äThus, people are becoming more  aware of and fight the existent war on the darkness of selling one's soul and by them destroying others as collateral damage, just to make an $$ income. By educating other life giving  choices -- not stealing to sustain one's means of living. Ultimately, I can see the ugly of why & how people violate others, don't care and wonder how anyone can rest at night.

Unfortunately, the documentary's content has bn going on very long time. Stealing & Selling Children.  Just Terrible! Body  snatching from above--underground installation, a village, the City or from the sea &  sky, has been  disturbingly more active these days. Victims are told they must crazy or go away or be killed should,  how did  pain & 111 stitches overnight unbeknownst, don't heal or life long anxiety of a missing child, traumatically is endured. Pure Torture. The Most High knows all. üåøI enjoyed watching film AND  am becoming more aware of how HUMAN Trafficking is indeed... Present and regionally different, in all its tragedy.  

üåø May safety, security, the recovery of love ones be had and the stopping of Human trafficking become enforced and, the norm in Divine value of Life, be not based on a damn dollar...  Not be selling a man, a series cocktail shot to stop one's clock,  nor  rape anyone's ESSENCE OF BEING by  Mind/Time Bending CTRL fuXkery and corrupted leadership.

Instead, the money is handed over and these scum will continue to cause devastation to another child, another family. I know the police are corrupt but that's another matter.

Firstly I would to to thank the lady that put her self out there to increase awareness on this society issue. But I must say that I‚Äôm deeply angry that the immoral people conducting these types of activities were not locked up, even though full evidence was there. This just shows how injustice our government is to the low income people. Secondly what really disappointment me was the fact that during the Filipino of this documentary , the team had a chance to save that one baby boy and ‚Äútrusted‚Äù a drug addict, alcoholic and children snatcher with the baby till the next day. This is the worst mistake that was made throughout the film, ( if it was me I would have taken the child straight away after she said that she stole the baby) that was a very stupid mistake made. That child is now added to missing children, and in this case this mistake was preventable. 
I cried throughout the whole video and I‚Äôm continuing to pray for god to provide the mothers  with strength and a miracle for the children to return back to their homes or atleast for the mother‚Äôs to find closure

What happens to many of these children is beyond the horrors that many could imagine. 
They can be tortured almost to death, while extracting their blood, high in adrenachr0me. The drug is processed, expensive and available to the rich and famous! These children have expiry dates. God only knows what happens to them then.
Many are sold as sex slaves to ped0phile rings. They will be used, sometimes bleeding to death from the trauma. Have you ever seen a child with two black eyes? It comes from the intense thrust during rapes forced on them!!! Think it doesn't happen? These horrid clips can be found on common social internet sites! Yet these sites claim it is very hard to find and take down those pages! (Even when the exact web address is SENT TO THEM?) Liars!
Besides Planner Parental00d selling fetus parts, there are many institutions that will pay top dollar for baby parts, blood, cells and organs. Where do stem cells come from for research labs?

Someone plz help, sue bcuz our constitutional rights are being taken away!!Look I'm a taxi driver and a nurse told me that they do free testing sites for covid-19. 
The way a person gets an appointment is by downloading an app and the person chooses the location closes to them by appointment. She had a Filipino accent so I couldn't understand why they shut down early but they had to shut down early. When they reopened the people that were not able to get their appointment due to the site shutting down early, returned  to that testing site upset because the app told them they were positive when they haven't been tested.  
FOLLOW THE MONEY, COVID IS REAL...but they are over exaggerating the death toll and the number of people that have tested positive for covid-19. ITS A SCAM PLANNED DEMIC. W√†tch meeting 201 on YouTube. 

IF WE DONT STOP ACTING LIKE ROBOTS AND STOP WEARING MASK WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR CAR, WALKING YOUR DOG, EXERCISING...THEY ARE GOING TO FORCE VACCINATE US ALL WITH A VENOMOUS VACCINE THAT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED LONG ENOUGH and people are getting SICK AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS TAKING DOWN THESE videos down.

This is a money move for the rich. Follow the money.

I picked up a guy in South San Francisco who either worked for big Pharma or the FDA, they share a parking lot and the conversation got heated because I told him that I beat cancer naturally and he told me that they were going to shut down people like me.

He told me well, they're going to start shutting down vitamin stores becuz people like you, think you're Doctor's...I said sir!...work for besides the devil? He said I'm not going to tell you! I told him look...I know where I picked you up  and you either work for big Pharma or the FDA. Look...you think you're some big shot because you think you got some insight to everything because of who you work for BUT IF YOU WERE TO GET CANCER, DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD GIVE YOU THE NEW TREATMENT FOR CANCER that they have, that would get rid of most Cancers in about 7 weeks. No...they would ZAP YOU WITH THEIR TOXIC CHEMOTHERAPY JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE!!! THEY LET John McCain DIE AND HE SERVED OUR COUNTRY and they'd let you die too...I'm alive because I knew better than to do CHEMO and you are hating on ME! SHame on you because I made it by studying cancer and ended up beating it? I told him you go tell your boss and whoever you work for that if you shutdown stores & stop selling these products I use to keep my cancer away, I will start a revolt in this country because I've seen enough of Big Pharma & the fda's corruption because I know what they're doing to the people with chemotherapy and radiation when they've got the cure because I've talked to many biotech engineers who told me that they can get rid of cancer with stem cell therapy/  immunotherapy...I said look its UP ITS ON YOUTUBE., Look up ""VISE"" - CALLED KILLING CANCER.. meanwhile we are ZAPPING OUR BABIES & LOVED ONES WITH TOXIC CHEMO THAT IS KILLING THEM & I'm not tolerating this anymore...I tell anyone that will listen to what I did. I shut him up. 
I took Super greens powder (the Country farm brand) from walmart.com 

Chaga mushrooms only by The natures way brand online because it's hard to find in stores but they are powerful mushrooms. (Will not get you high lol sorry) 

I took Pau D' Arco (""Natures way"" brand) take as directed but you must take and stop for 3, 5 to 7 days to rest the kidneys (u can take it for 10,15 &up to 30 d√†ys but  then repeat as the bottle suggest & stop for the above duration...it √†ll depends on the height, weight & kidneys.
I boil a cup of water & added 1/4 teaspoon of Baking soda two to three times a day. That also must be stopped if you feel dizzy (it just means that you're over alkaline- no biggie- it beat CHEMOTHERAPY trust me. 
I took aloe vera capsules, I buy them at the vitamin shop. I take 2 or 3 in the morning, 2 to 3 at Lunch & 2 or 3  before bedtime. (Again scale down dose if it's hard on the kidneys) 

I took CBD oil under my tongue two or three times a day. It must be a indica grade plant not a sativa or something comparable to indica plant. 
Tumeric is good to take also (Google a good brand with 5 stars rating) 

Stop drinking all soda, sugar, bread because it turns into sugar. Stop eating all fast food, you must stop eating meat, eggs, milk with hormones, I eat all beans of all kinds, all homemade salad and homemade salad dressing. A quick salad dressing is made with a good olive oil (from another country, not the U.S.A.) red wine vinegar and lemon with all the spice's you like. 

The salad dressing that they sell us in the stores 9 times out of 10 has carrageenan & xanthan gum which is very bad for us.. look up how bad these products are for us. 

Stop eating all cereal, pretty much it is filled with a bunch of junk and high sugar content. 

Download the fooducate app. pick food from B+ & higher, try to stick with food that's b+ and above. 
if you touch/hit the grade of your food on this app, you can see all the junk that's in it. 

Take yourself off the high risk food and put yourself on the low-risk food. 

Download the think dirty app, grades all your lotions, potion shampoos and toothpaste etc. Stop wearing makeup becuz they're putting a bunch of junk that cause us all sorts of cancers. 

We must defund big Pharma and the FDA because they are harming us and not helping us. 

People live longer in other countries because they eat natural fruits and vegetables that don't have all the pesticides and herbicides that the FDA allows in our food. DO YOU THINK THAT THE FDA IS REALLY GOING TO APPROVE A VACCINE THAT'S HEALTHY FOR US!? 

BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BY TAKING VITAMINS AND MINERALS AND SUPER GREENS POWDER. With covid-19 u must take zinc, D3 & Vitamin C.,.ITS EASY. 

STOP BELIEVING THE NEWS WHO ARE OWNED BY ALL THE RICH PEOPLE THAT HAVE AN AGENDA TO KEEP US SICK & ON THEIR BIG PHARMA PILLS. I believe that the 1918 flu was also a scam & the elitist were also killing ppl. 

THEY'RE RUNNING A CAMPAIGN RECENTLY TO HAVE YOU GO GET TESTED FOR CANCER. ITS A CAMPAIGN TO MAKE THEM LOTS $$.
 YOU'LL HEAR COMMERCIALS ALL DAY LONG ABOUT THIS. 
JUST DO THE ABOVE THINGS MINUS THE PAU D ARCO. AND DONT DO THE baking soda tea as often, just like 3 times a week or so. 

DISCLOSURES: 
I AM NOT A DOCTOR, YOU MUST CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING ANYTING, THIS IS NOT FDA-APPROVED, I'M NOT TRYING TO CURE ANYONE FROM ANYTING. 

DON'T LET THEM TAKE YOUR Life AWAY FROM YOU, I CALLED THE POLICE & THEY ARE NOT ENFORCING THE SHUTDOWN IN LA COUNTY, RIVERSIDE COUNTIES OR ORANGE COUNTIES. 

FOLOW: PEGGY HALL- THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.ORG - ON YOUTUBE 
U CAN DOWNLOAD ALL HER DOCUMENTS JUST IN CASE THE CITY, COUNTY ALLSTATE TRIES TO CLOSE YOUR BUSINESS DOWN. THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND A JUDGE ALREADY SAID THAT A VIRUS DOES NOT OVERRIDE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. 

Follow DR. RICHARD BARTLETT MD FROM TEXAS, DR. SCOTT JENSEN, DOCTOR NEPUTE, DR. BUTTAR AND DR. SHIVA. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE AMERICAN FRONTLINE DOCTORS.ORG OR .COM... ALL ON THE SUBJECT OF COVID-19 AND THE SHUTDOWN. 

MANY MIRE DOCTORS ARE SPEAKING OUT WRITTEN BOOKS RECENTLY AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON. 

PLEASE SPEAK OUT BECAUSE UF YOU DONT FIGHT BACK COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM WILL TAKE OVER OUR COUNTRY FASTER THAN YOU THINK. 

STOP SIGNING THESE PETITIONS AT THE GROCERY STORES BECAUSE RICH PEOPLE PASSING LAWS RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES THAT DON'T BENEFIT US. 

WE MUST START WRITING PETITIONS ON CHANGE.ORG AND PASS THEM AROUND THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. 
SOCIAL MEDIA IS SHUTTING US DOWN SO WE HAVE TO GO TO OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA VENUES THAT IS NOT FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE TO PASS THESE PETITIONS AROUND SO WE CAN SIGN THEM. 

WE MUST TAKE THESE PEOPLE TO COURT TO PROVE THE TRUE SCIENCE OF COVID-19 AND GO IN TO COURT WITH SOME OF THESE DOCTOR'S AND THE PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH THE AUTISM MAGAZINE SND FIGHT BACK. 

IF YOUR DOCTOR OR SCIENTIST YOU MUST PUT A BAG OVER YOUR HEAD AND GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELL THE TRUTH AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE THE AMERICA AND THE WORLD YOU ONCE  KNEW IS BEING TAKEN OVER BY THE RICH GREEDY CROOKS. 

WATCH THE MOVIE ""ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD"" AND YOU'LL SEE THE HEART OF WHO IS RUNNING OUR WORLD. GREED IS RUNNING OUR NATION AND THEY MUST BE STOPPED. 
 
WATCH THE MOVIE CONTAGION, AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY HAVE PLANNED THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THERE ARE MANY OTHER MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE. 

WATCH MEETING 2021 WITH BILL GATES ON YOUTUBE AND WILBERT'S EUGENICS PROJECT. 

AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST Y'ALL BETTER WAKE UP!!!

This is a verified network of Canadian social workers and transition house workers that are working together to wrongfully permanently kidnap healthy babies from Canadian Mothers who are also healthy and have done nothing wrong to their children. The network has a specific system set up that targets vulnerable Mothers in domestic violence situations for the fraudulent permanent adoptions using false accusations. For example, false claims of mental health or claims that the Mother is unsafe because she cannot escape the abusive Father. The babies are then permanently adopted out no matter how hard the Mother fights against the fraudulent apprehensions. BBC4LIFE"

@thechosen5768,15/12/2020 01:39,0,0,"He or She that commits sin is of the devil, I John 3:8 (I John 3:8). If you are into lying, cheating, bitterness, keeping malice, pride, manifesting anger, quarrelling, unforgiving, hatred, envy, contention, strife, bitterness, cursing, speaking evil of others, taking or giving bribe, selfishness, deception, kidnapping, smuggling, falsification of documents, swearing, extortion and other sinful character dispositions, you must repent (Colossians 3:5-9; Romans 1:29-32; Proverbs 6:16-19). 
Such evil and wicked character will hinder the manifestation of God‚Äôs abundant blessings upon your life. If you are into lust, masturbation, fornication, adultery, prostitution (private or public), patronizing prostitutes, abortion, lesbianism, homosexuality, bestiality, watching pornography (I Corinthians 6:9-10), immoral thoughts or any act of immorality, you need to repent (Galatians 5:19-21; Mathew 5:28; Mark 7:21-23). Jesus loves you and wants to save you.

Are you into idolatry? Are you into cultism, whether open or secret cult? Do you practice witchcraft or Yoga? Do you smoke cigarette or cannabis? Do you sell them or offer them to people? Do you smoke or sniff hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, captain black, hashish or other banned drugs or snuff? Are you lusting - lusting after men or women, covetous, alcohol drinking (proverbs 31:4-6)? You must repent, stop them and give your life to Jesus Christ. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. 
Are you into marry and divorce? Then you are a sinner. Are you married to more than one person? Repent!! Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marriage is for better and for worse until death separates (Matthew 19:3-6). ‚ÄòWherefore they are no more two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder (separate)‚Äô. Cheating on your wife or husband is sin. Proverbs 28: 13 says, ‚Äò‚ÄòHe that covers his sins shall not prosper...You must repent of them, confess and forsake them (1 John 1:9). 
Are you into worldliness? Don‚Äôt you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? (James 4:4; II John2:15-17). So, you must stop bleaching your body or painting your mouth, eyes, hands and legs or fixing attachments, weave-on, earrings (Genesis 35:2-4), bangles, chains and frying or perming your hair. Tattooing your body is satanic. Are you one of those that put on nude dresses, short skirts, transparent dresses to seduce men or women (a Seducer or a Promoter of lust is a Sinner ‚Äì Mathew 5:28) 

Perhaps you wear trousers as a woman? (Read Deuteronomy 22:5), that is an abomination (Revelation 21:8, 27). Therefore, make up your mind, repent and give your life to Jesus Christ. Are you spoilt? Jeremiah 4:30 says, ‚Äò‚ÄòAnd when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. They will seek thy life‚Äô‚Äô. (2 Kings 9:30; Hosea 2:13; Exodus 33:1-6) 
A Christian is not a Sinner and a Sinner is not a Christian (I John 3:9). If you must be a blessed child of God, then you must repent of your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ. If you believe Jesus Christ today, righteousness of God will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion (1 John 11-12). If you neglect this call to repentance and salvation and die, you will not escape fire of Hell (Hebrews 2:3). It is foolishness and sin to say or think that there is no God (Psalm 14:1; 9:17). Luke 13:3, Jesus said, ‚ÄòI tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish‚Äô. Cut off every besetting sin (Hebrew 12:1-2; Mark 9:43-48). 

If you have decided now (2 Corinthians 6:2) to give your life to Jesus Christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, please say this prayer: 
Almighty God, I come unto you in the name of Jesus. Father I confess that I am a sinner. All my sins I confess to you. 
I am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). Lord I promise you that from today I will never continue in them anymore. I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification. 
Almighty God, use the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Lord Jesus, come into my heart, be my Lord and personal Saviour. I surrender my life to you. Cancel my name from the books of death and write it in the book of life. Give me power to sin no more. In Jesus name I pray. Amen!!

1John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
Hell is a place of torment forever...continuous burning by fire. The fire is never quenched, with crying and weeping forever (Mark 9:43-48; Psalm 9:17; Mathew 25:41). It was originally prepared for satan and his demons, but anybody that obeys the devil in committing sin and refuse to repent and accept Jesus Christ, if the person dies in sins, he or she will be thrown into Hell. You still have the opportunity to repent now, amend your ways, live and spend eternity in heaven. Go to www.tlccrm.org 
You may be asking; how do I stop all these sins? Simply take the first step of repentance and have inner hatred for those sins, then ask Jesus to forgive you and come into your life to be your Lord and personal Saviour. In John 1:12, there is power that will be given to you, and in Mathew 11:28, if you receive Jesus into your life, He will deliver you and give you victory over those sins; then you will need to cut off from the source of those sins in your life (may be sinful friends; stop the evil relationship. 
This gospel is not to condemn you, but for you to be convicted so that you will repent and give your life to Jesus Christ who loves you and really wants you to make it to heaven at the end of your life here on earth"

    In your report, you have not included one single interview with a hospital executive or anyone from law enforcement.  Not one interview with those in positions of responsibility and authority.  
    At the very least, your ""brave"" undercover reporters should have confronted law enforcement officials with their evidence, DEMANDING a response and some kind of ACTION. Otherwise, this was a year-long waste of time.  This is sham reporting, BBC.  Lazy and incomplete.

I went there to Kenya in 1993 and it seems not much has changed with the poverty despite all the charitable aid from lots of countries like UK and USA etc. To see children living in extreme poverty and appalling housing conditions its a disgrace. The Kenyan Government are very rich and living high standards of living and yet they allow the vast majority to  live in the most dreadful conditions. shame on the Kenyan Government to let this happen in 2020.
@Angel-nz1jh,04/12/2020 18:53,0,0,Putting people like Anita in jail won‚Äôt be enough. They have no heart and soul. They sell steal and sell babies sometimes for sacrifice üò°. They deserve torture over death. There is no sympathy for people who can‚Äôt have mercy for these babies and their mothers . Anita‚Äô s life is not enough to pay for her own sins.

(THE GREATEST PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME) 

God Bless You Donald Trump and give you the courage, strength and wisdom, to be on the right side of destiny, to be the greatest president the USA has ever had!! 
Sir you have achieved more in your 1st term in office than all the previous presidents combined. 
Once people realise and really wake up, and see your hand in the down fall of the cabal, the global elites, the corrupt bankers, mainstream media,politicians, the various royal families in the world and their insatiable thirst for adrenochrome and other nefarious activities. 
To gain the fountain of youth they have needlessly enslaved young children and trafficked them like disposable goods. All In the pursuit of their own insatiable greed & vanity, they have sacrificed their humanity and are pure evil and satanic to the core. 
Once people realise your great military war against the deep state, and all the 5 million children that you have rescued from dumbs (deep underground military bases). You will become a national & international hero.
Posterity will confirm and history will record. That You Sir, will be remembered as the Greatest President of The USA. Who has actually given the power back to the people, aswell as their liberty & freedoms. May the sun always shine, on the glorious New Republic, that you have newly created, once the US goes back to constitutional law and away from corrupt marine law. 
Most importantly though Sir you will be remembered as the greatest peace maker and humanitarian. 
I can only reiterate that Donald you are an amazing man and inspirational in your vision. I can only wish you a very long live, aswell as your incredible family. 
God bless the USA and the rest of the world.
MAGA!!!!"

He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's just 6, I have tried several treatments and medications, nothing was working out, this got me frustrated and depressed. I kept praying and finally God answered my prayers when someone from youtube introduced me to this doctor from his home country and  gave me his contact details.
I called and explained my son's condition after which I made an order for his herbal remedy, he asked for my address and the next day I got a tracking number for a parcel sent to me through DHL and after four days I received my order. 
It was a liquid herbal medicine and a letter containing the instructions on how to use the herbs, I called him again to confirm and the next morning I started giving my son the herbs as instructed and after one week I noticed great improvement on my son and I continued until the herbs got finished and everything lasted for just one month and now my son is totally free from Autism, he can now talk clearly, behave normally and has no more seizures.

These mothers should come together and take turns     watching their children twenty four seven. Take turns sleeping. In the nights place the children in the middle mothers form a circle around the children. I have not seen no males around. Where are the Fathers. What affect one mother of a child that has been stolen should be the concern of all. After all no mother knows whose child will be next. These mothers are victims of circumstances. No home being Chief. I can see real love in the mothers eyes  voice. Reporters investigators please just take a que from my comment have meetings with these mothers and educate these mothers how they can help each other with their children living on the street. The same can be done to mothers in hospitals and clinics as well. There comes a day when all of us will have to give account to God for the works we have done wither good or bad. No sin will go unpunished. God bless you. Keep up the good news. God will come through for these hurting mothers no  matter how long it takes. I am a Jamaican. One love. Thanks.

That lady Anita most likely went back to the original buyer and told them she has gotten a better offer of 80k and needs more. If that was your route of choice, i.e. buying that child, you could have offered 250k Kenyan shillings which would have outbid any buyer. Most likely she sold the wonderful kid off for about 90k. When she showed up the following day with no kid, you should have acted and picked her up there and then. In a nutshell, your team got it totally wrong. Would you have done this with a high profile child who is declared missing?"

She is a drug addict and will want to get that baby sold asap for two reasons-she doesn‚Äôt want people to actually see her with the baby and so she can get the money and get her drugs. Especially if it‚Äôs herion she‚Äôs addicted to. The reporter should have gone straight to the police and show them where the baby is to not risk losing that baby. And if that is futile because of police corruption then she should have paid off the police herself or find someone trustworthy to steal the baby back and then search for the baby‚Äôs mother because if her baby was stolen she is going to be going mad trying to find it and therefore she may be easy to locate. And then at the very least you can insure the baby‚Äôs safety in the meantime."

@kilosnow8275,22/11/2020 22:06,0,0,"The big mistake  is also the broadcaster and the way they handled things. They  could have presented the evidence to the hospital ,  and police afterwards- they don't mention this. They also missed a chance to save a baby , as they could have ' taken'  the baby from the woman who had stolen it or called her out whilst police came.  The broadcaster and production team should also have anticipated  the possibility that she might not appear the following day . Therefore the chance to save the baby under their nose  was missed for ever . Its no use reporting some thing and conclude the perpetrator did  not speak to respond , etc  That  tactic does not work in Africa, they must know that.  They don't say whether or not the informers were paid ; eg the $ 3000 paid in cash by the woman at the hospital posing as a customer-   where did she get the money  that she didn't seem too concerned about losing as she was not going to keep the baby.  Was this paid by the broadcaster-a few things don't add up . The programme did not offer any solution  in the end therefore what was the purpose apart from  being an intriguing topic for the middle classes.  The people who need the most  help are unlikely  be alerted by the programme as are unlikely to have a TV set nor the electricity to power it."

@moikressly,22/11/2020 13:49,0,0,"1 - When you were speaking to Anita, you should never have used the word Arrested. It sends an alert... You should have simply said and everything went peaceful. People pick things from your own words so you have to choose your words carefully and not use words that bring alert. 
2 - The fact that she appeared without the child was already a sign that she was being suspicious and for her to do that business she is not dumb and that is certainly not the third traffic she was doing. She might have done it several times so she can tell when something looks fishy.
3 - When she mentioned 80 k you did not even bargain. No real customer will do that. You were supposed to reduce it at least to 40 and insist on her reducing the price because it was a baby you were supposed not to have seen. So u should have bargain like a serious customer. 
4 - Anita looks poor but seems to be in that business for a while and knows her way around it, that means the money goes to someone else's pocket, that means she has a boss that she sort of reports to, someone who makes the great profit from it. So Anita was the key to someone well-positioned"

The only thing different about this is that (the reporter is paying the illegal owners in order to release this story); is not a hard fact.  Meaning the reporter needs a story; so she PAID the owners to be filmed and their faces to appear.  This nothing new.  The reporter is very aware of this; that is why there was NO ARREST!  There will NEVER BE ANY...EVER!.  These women are extremely poor and due to those facts, they sell their children like a loaf of bread.  These same women will become pregnant again and return to the same type of scenarios.   I have loads of compassion for the women who 'TRULY LOVE THEIR CHILDREN'..Those newborns and very young children would be sold, traded as sacrifices, and the worst used as sexual toys for many sick people in the world.  This is a fact.  In America, there are many agencies that are available to help protect the innocence of a child for safety measures.  Even with all that, we have in America...many children are kidnapped, abused and the worst sold into some form of child sex trafficking continuously."

The Act of 1871: The ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù Is a Corporation ‚Äì There are Two Constitutions

ACT OF 1871 GO TO FEDERALJACK.COM FOR FULL ARTICLE
Since the Act of 1871 which established the District of Columbia, we have been living under the UNITED STATES CORPORATION which is owned by certain international bankers,aristocracy of Europe and Britain, KEPT TOGETHER BY ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HOSPITALS OWNED BY GOV AND INVESTORS, IRS, COURTS, CREATED AND RAN BY ATTORNEYS AND LAWYERS.

In 1871 the Congress changed the name of the original Constitution by changing ONE WORD ‚Äî and that was very significant as you will read.

Some people do not understand that ONE WORD or TWO WORDS difference in any ‚Äúlegal‚Äù document DO make the critical difference. But, Congress has known, and does know, this.

1871, February 21: Congress Passes an Act to Provide a Government for the District of Columbia, also known as the Act of 1871.

With no constitutional authority to do so, Congress creates a separate form of government for the District of Columbia, a ten mile square parcel of land (see, Acts of the Forty-first Congress,‚Äù Section 34, Session III, chapters 61 and 62).

The act ‚Äî passed when the country was weakened and financially depleted in the aftermath of the Civil War ‚Äî was a strategic move by foreign interests (international bankers) who were intent upon gaining a stranglehold on the coffers and neck of America.


Congress cut a deal with the international bankers (specifically Rothschilds of London) to incur a DEBT to said bankers. Because the bankers were not about to lend money to a floundering nation without serious stipulations, they devised a way to get their foot in the door of the United States.

The Act of 1871 formed a corporation called THE UNITED STATES. The corporation, OWNED by foreign interests, moved in and shoved the original Constitution into a dustbin. With the Act of 1871, the organic Constitution was defaced ‚Äî in effect vandalized and sabotage ‚Äî when the title was capitalized and the word ‚Äúfor‚Äù was changed to ‚Äúof‚Äù in the title.

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is the constitution of the incorporated UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

It operates in an economic capacity and has been used to fool the People into thinking it governs the Republic. It does is not!

Capitalization is NOT insignificant when one is referring to a legal document. This seemingly ‚Äúminor‚Äù alteration has had a major impact on every subsequent generation of Americans.

What Congress did by passing the Act of 1871 was create an entirely new document, a constitution for the government of the District of Columbia, an INCORPORATED government. This newly altered Constitution was not intended to benefit the Republic. It benefits only the corporation of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and operates entirely outside the original (organic) Constitution.

Instead of having absolute and unalienable rights guaranteed under the organic Constitution, we the people now have ‚Äúrelative‚Äù rights or privileges. One example is the Sovereign‚Äôs right to travel, which has now been transformed (under corporate government policy) into a ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù that requires citizens to be licensed.

By passing the Act of 1871, Congress committed TREASON against the People who were Sovereign under the grants and decrees of the Declaration of Independence and the organic Constitution.

The Act of 1871 became the FOUNDATION of all the treason since committed by government officials.

YOU SEE... the attorneys and Lawyers created this fraudulent system apart from the real United States. They the attorneys are in every aspect of this system to keep the bind Servents - Second class Citizens- Slaves or American Citizens in check and accounted for as you are property that belongs to the federal government which is why they think they can tell you that you can only have three people at your Thanksgiving meal. This is why the federal government can take your children from your home and tried to take your guns because the contractually on you through your birth certificate that is why the hospital as well not really let you leave until you signed up for those documents at the hospital. Hospitals are not innocent in this matter their for-profit corporation that work very closely with the federal government, the media, and of course the lawyers and IRS you are an investment. You are owned by many countries. You are a Gamble as so how much money you will make in a given year and how much money the fraudulent IRS made possibly collect. I've been asked over and over again how do we get out of the system? You can go down to the Embassy pay the $2,500 let them know you want to be a u.s. National as our forefathers intended. You are no longer under the jurisdiction of the federal and state governments you are no longer in that the jurisdiction of their fraudulent court system, THE FRAUDULENT GOVERMENT, POLICE, THE ILLEGAL IRS, ALL RAN BY LAWYERS AND ATTORNEY S THAT USE LEGALESE TO HIDE THE TRUTH. Look up the Black Law's dictionary definition for human being. You'll be surprised. We are animals and the attorneys and lawyers eyes. Listen to The healthcare trials on YouTube. Lawyers talking to lawyers talking to judges that are just lawyers in the black robe. They are finding ways to implement laws against the American people. They are going through the health-care Law's only to find a way to legally send someone to prison if they don't pay for healthcare. Right now there is no laws that someone can go to jail. But the courts are trying to find a loophole and two Getting people into the system. What can you do? You can denounce your citizenship and become a u.s. national have all the luxuries of a US citizen but now you are and Noble. Like the attorneys and politicians American Indians and other communities where God is there absolute, are out of the jurisdiction of the federal state governments courts and IRS. That's why you did not hear much about the Muslim communities they have their own police force. You never hear about the American Indian communities because they have their own government."

By failing to do that BBC is allowing it to continue. The Kenyan police are likely complicit in a lot of it and are getting bribes from these traffickers as is the usual way in Kenya but BBC should take all this to the authorities once filming had ended. Out of the three traffickers, the BBC only got the police involved in one . That doesn't seem like very responsive journalism from BBC, especially when kids are at risk daily by the individuals in this film. What's the point in making these investigative documents if it doesn't affect change. Is it just for the entertainment of British people who watch them?"

Secondly, I believe someone from the Kenyan police alerted Anita(the human trafficker) and that is why she did not have the baby and failed to appear at 5.

 Last, As a nativeBlack American descendant of ancestors stolen and sold into the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade for centuries, this level of  trafficked humans, babies and children angers me to the core.

He is probably busy selling other babies knowing none will arrest him. I believe even Anita was tipped off by one of the police not to bring the baby @ 5pm as they had agreed. This seems like a big scam involving a lot of people even in high offices.

Tell us how men are are committing suicide at unprecedented levels mostly due to denied child access. Social services are no different from this morons. In fact social services are worse because they do it legally. They consider children as clients and without clients they have no jobs so they opt of cooking up allegations and breaking up families in order to steal the children. At least Kenyans can excuse themselves with poverty brought by colonialism. What‚Äôs the UK excuse? 
I once had happy healthy child but women‚Äôs aid and social services decided to help incapable mother to hide with the child so in case she‚Äôs unable to cope they will take the child away. They even encouraged mother to make up allegations of ‚Äúdomestic abuse‚Äù even though their assessments proved otherwise. Today my child is obese and mentally abused.

Why confront the doctor when you already have enough evidence to incriminate him? Why didn‚Äôt you have the police arrest him?

Guess what their is so much corruption in the country that these people will never be held in prison. 
The mothers who have abandoned their children in hospitals are so very poor and leave their children to whoever will give their children a better future.
The children are thereafter sold or stolen or put in orphanages where they are abused and mistreated.
They are laws but the people who are put in positions to protect children are the ones selling and mistreating them. 
We have the most poor infrastructure for poor ppl. Mothers give birth on the floor. Nurses and doctors and underpaid so they do things under the table to make ends meet and Don't give proper care to patients
The even sell donated supplies and medication. 
If you go to the police. They will write on a piece of paper a number and That's it. They are also underpaid and could care less about your problem. Unless you bribe them."

Such ease of criminality, speaks of a hospital culture and staff at peace with having a  disregard for children's safety and lives.

You did all this to show these bastards how you operate? And for what? Nobody's arrested or jailed. Even the illegal clinic still thrives in KENYA. Why didn't you wrestle her down the first time and take that baby she had stole? Too me your investigations are too soft. You and your officials not trying to stop this, you just advertising  to psychos where they can pay money and get a child. 
If you really want to help, get those mothers off the streets and train  them to become better protectors of their children.  Some will listen, at least those who love their children. Forget the police, they the ones who probably tipped anita off. And if you ever see Anita, WHOOP HER ASS!!! So bad she never want to see another baby again!

@willielastborn,16/11/2020 21:25,0,0,So why were the journalists not accompanied by police officers in their final deal with Fred??? How did they lose 300K in a shambolic deal and will they recover that?? Why would they tell him that they know he is involved in children trafficking yet they would have approached the police to arrest him?? I feel that the journalists failed to accomplish something that would have taught a lesson to many others.... Fred will now ask for a transfer or even resign from work meaning he can continue his business at Kisumu where no one will come looking for him. Anita is nowhere to be seen therefore the business continues. We have always  known that there's children trafficking in Kenya. What I thought this investigative piece would achieve is the arrest part.. The ending for me was a bit disappointing...

Making things difficult just moves things dangerously underground. We have scholars and thinkers around who specialise in these matters. Let's find a far-reaching, human solution please."

Gross crime will be reported, exposed, and months later, the same will be repeated by the same institutions in a  kwani mtado? attitude .

@sowhat2598,16/11/2020 09:02,13,3,"Ni interesting sana kuona middle class Kenyans wakicomplain kwa comments ati 'authorities should take action' ukweli ni sisi wenyewe hatutado shit na ata nyinyi mnajua. Hao 'authorities' ndio worse. Hawa wakisema ati wanapeleka watoi childrens home kwanza ndo inahuzunisha, mnakumbuka last year kulikua na ile sarakasi at Child welfare society, huyo mama CEO (Irene Mureithi) akitesa watoto na kuiba pesa ya kuwachunga (Na vile mama Jayden hupenda kupeana pesa huko), mara sijui machinku wanawaexperimentia kama wanyama alafu early this year akakua reinstated with full authority ya kucontrol bank accounts coz that's what it's all about...the MONEY, hakuna kitu ingine. Hizi ma childrens home as much as kuna zenye ziko legit na kusaidia watoto, mingi ni za kukula donor funding hakuna kitu ingine. Hizi documentary zimetengenezwa mob sana ata nyinyi mmeona hizo clips wametumia mwanzo ya hii stuff, na msisahau 'missionaries' wenye hukuja hapa kedefile watoi. Kuna ule mzungu(Gregory Dow-registered sex offender in Amerikkka) mwenye hadi alikua anasaidiwa na chief na kulipwa pesa ndogo ndogo. Extradition treaty yetu na hao watu ni ya kutuma wakenya huko but wanyama ka huyo mjamaa hawafanyiwi shiet.

Wengi wanauliza kwa comments eti mbona hii rende haiku peleka hii evidence kwa makarao but ata nyinyi mnajua makarao watadai tu dooh na hii shit iishe hivo, kando na hiyo, ata hawa si eti wanatengeneza hii docie ndio walete change, ni story na dooh. Hawa pia ni wa 'Civil Society' aka Tupee donations. Si eti nawalaumu juu ukweli ni kwamba wao pia lazma wakule na wazungu pia lazaima wa 'donate.' NGO ni biz simple as that. Kama mmegutuka sana na hii kitu basi mfanye harambee muende mfanye citizen arrest na private prosecution sheria ipo, exhibit ndio hii. Sana sana huyo jamaa wa mama Lucy na huyo mathee wa 'clinic' But ukweli ni as long as haikuaffect hakuna incentive ya kudo shit na ukianza court case yenyewe itaisha 2030, it sucks, if circumstances were different hawa watoto wanauzwa ingekua wewe au hata mtoto wako. Lakini hadi lini wasee."

This is confusing to me. Something different has to be done laws need to be changed in order for our lives to be saved. If nobody steps up and do what's right what is a hope?
